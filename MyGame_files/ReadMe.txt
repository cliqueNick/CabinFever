This program is a simple isometric game where the goal is to put out the fires by picking up the puddles of water. Despite my inexperience with making video games this fills the desire of my younger siblings to play a video game that I made.

There is no need to install this program, just run the ‘MyGame.py’ file or double click the batch file labeled ‘play_MyGame.bat’ on a Windows machine. This file should be in the same directory as the ‘data’ directory, ‘MyGame_game_play.py’, ‘MyGame_intro.py’, and ‘MyGame_objects.py’ files.   

It requires installation of Python and pygame (http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).
